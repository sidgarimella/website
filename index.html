I build software and currently work on making computer automation accessible at <a href="https://prefix.app/">Prefix</a>.

Previously, I attended a small college near Boston, and worked stints at Stanford, Roku, State Street, and a few startups, publishing a bit of writing on my blog, <a href="https://foci.substack.com/">foci</a>, and in the <a href="https://www.ijcaonline.org/">IJCA</a> along the way.

I currently live and work out of the bay area.

On my spare time I maintain a few <a href="https://github.com/sidgarimella/conveyor">software</a> <a href="https://leadgem.io/">side</a> <a href="https://getpixtel.com/">projects</a>, practice recurve archery, and attempt <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emily-Paris-Recipes-Youre-Alone/dp/B095GP97PN">challenging recipes</a>.

If you’d like to contact me, my best email is sid at prefix dot app. 




A few things I think about:

- replace private schools with a few full time private tutors that families can pool resources for and hold close relationships with
- apple's copy text from photos thingy but a chrome extension that enables this natively on my desktop
- market for making people appear smart is certainly distinct from the one actually making people more productive and there's a little overlap we've yet to master (see every graph based notes app)
- backing up & getting visibility into zapier workflows, some places really go crazy with it and I often don't find the native logs and alerts very helpful
- highlight a region of code and hit ctrl z to only undo stuff in that area
- more front end docs should look like this (https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/nuxt) with 1:1 directory structures in the sidebar
- space gas stations, getting good at what fuel management for it might look like
- creator demonetization insurance
- something like nvidia's maxine but higher compression for cloud game streaming
- a hashicorp vault sorta thing but it also auto refreshes oauth tokens and keeps them on hand for ipaas backends
- time dilation in vr, tricking brains to create more time that we can learn stuff in
- thrasio but for open source repos
- someone please 3d print and distribute hookah pipe holders that clip onto tables, leaving them lying around is ridiculous
- device chargers with portable batteries that also charge when plugged in so I can charge both at once
- emails can be way richer. I don't trust google to keep dynamic emails healthy but unique application views/front-ends could be created for inboxes, lots could happen.
- speculative consumer good marketplace plugin to signal buying intent for concepts on online storefronts. something does this already, just not sure why it's not in more places.
- labor utilization– work comes in waves for swe's, co's are paying for a lot of unutilized bandwidth vs like spot instances, held together by org knowledge and contract overhead?
- a superior gcp client that internally keeps up to date with every time google changes api's and doesn't require a dozen auth/migration patterns to work with
- we should totally revisit the znamya space mirror stuff for solar or remote work or something idk 
- segment for all the prospecting/leadgen tools, each one sorta tries and fails at being a crm, some have syncs some don't, all have different names for stages, etc.
- whatever's happening here is amazing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJTz7h3o44I&ab_channel=LukeDiebold
- an elite cobol dev shop to maintain core banking infra 20-30 years from now when everyone's ai copilot braindead and the hardest cs class is intro python
- intermittently screenshotting sites is cool, but being able to turn regions of sites into responsive iframes for ops dashboards would be cooler
- scanning and making actionable api calls underlying website form submissions, sometimes these are gated/require session info, but totally superior to dealing with screen scraping if solved
- inverse postman where i configure a request and every time i update a dev server it reloads and that request is run against it
- two step protecting file operations, files that can expire/be protected without landing on a bunch of servers

A few books I particularly like:

- The Alchemist
- The Three-Body Problem
- The Inner Game of Tennis
- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenence
- Consider the Lobster
