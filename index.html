I build software and currently work on making computer automation accessible at <a href="https://prefix.app/">Prefix</a>.

Previously, I attended a small college near Boston, and worked stints at Stanford, Roku, State Street, and a few startups, publishing a bit of writing on my blog, <a href="https://foci.substack.com/">foci</a>, and in the <a href="https://www.ijcaonline.org/">IJCA</a> along the way.

I currently live and work out of the bay area.

On my spare time I maintain a few <a href="https://github.com/sidgarimella/conveyor">software</a> <a href="https://leadgem.io/">side</a> <a href="https://getpixtel.com/">projects</a>, practice recurve archery, and attempt <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emily-Paris-Recipes-Youre-Alone/dp/B095GP97PN">challenging recipes</a>.

If you’d like to contact me, my best email is sid at prefix dot app. 




A few things I've thought a bit about:

- replacing private schools with a network of private tutors that families can pool resources for and hold close long-term relationships with. people can likely learn along quite different rates from what is broadly prescribed
- the market for making people appear smart is certainly distinct from the one actually making people more productive and there's a little overlap we've yet to master (every graph based notes app/insta ad for software)
- a hashicorp vault sorta thing but it also auto refreshes oauth tokens and keeps them on hand for ipaas backends
- time dilation in vr/in general, infinitely valuable if we can trick brains to create more usable time that we can learn stuff in
- modern labor utilization– work comes in waves for swe's, co's are paying for a lot of unutilized bandwidth vs like spot instances, held together by org knowledge and contract overhead?
- an elite cobol dev shop to maintain core banking infra 20-30 years from now when everyone's ai copilot braindead and the hardest cs class is intro python
- creator demonetization insurance
- revisiting the znamya space mirror for solar or remote work or something idk. that stuff was so cool.
- premium third party gcp client that internally keeps up to date with every time google changes api's and doesn't require a dozen auth/migration patterns to work with
- thrasio style rollup of lesser known open source repos into cheap, professional support plans for businesses that use them
- apple's copy text from photos thingy but a chrome extension that enables this natively on my desktop
- highlight a region of code and hit ctrl z to only undo stuff in that area, ctrl z's that persist through opening/closing saved files to recapture your train of thought

A few books I particularly like:

- The Alchemist
- The Three-Body Problem
- The Inner Game of Tennis
- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenence
- Consider the Lobster
